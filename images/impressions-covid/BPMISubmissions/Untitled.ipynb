      "Ken Goldman is an artist based in Israel. His art is filled with insider references innuendos and humor. While at times seemingly irreverent - the works are inspired by and react to; traditional, texts, and rituals. He sees his art as a vehicle for promoting dialogue, a catalyst for provoking people into re-evaluating their preconceptions, a medium for breaking down stereotypes, and an opportunity for people of all walks of life to connect with theirs and others' religion, culture, and history.\n",

      "## About Artwork\n",
      "The current situation in the context of a pandemic led to the fact that, faced with the obligation of compulsory isolation, the structural inequality of my country became evident. Quarantine today is a privilege that many cannot have due to the conditions that violate their rights to a formal job, the exacerbated regional disparity and the social groups that are usually already at risk, experience it as a terrible reality. The laziness of years never democratized basic sanitary conditions, one of the simplest actions in the prevention of covid-19, such as washing our hands, is the greatest desire of those who today don`t have access to water. In the most populated capital city of the country, in the most vulnerable neighborhoods even today after months of quarantine, there is a lack of water. The pandemic spat in our faces that it is time to question the social dynamics and urgencies in public policy that in the meantime are taking the lives of many.\n",

      "### Introduction:\n",
      "Kayla Tange was born in South Korea and adopted by a Japanese American family. Her love for poetry and photography slowly progressed into a conceptual performance practice which incorporates elements of exotic dancing. Physical and psychic boundaries, sexuality and  permanence are also recurring themes. She often uses dark comedy in her performance work to explore love and longing, societal taboos and catharsis. She is the co-producer of Sacred Wounds, a show around ritual, subverting cultural stereotypes and ancestral healing.\n",

      "A painting in response to losing her job as a dancer during the pandemic. What helped lessen her anxiety of lost wages, lost identity and the freedom of a part time job during school was food preservation in the form of pickling, where she began directing her energy into experimenting making various kinds of pickles. Jokingly, alluding to “hanging heels” up in exchange for pickled vegetables. Some have commented on how domesticity shows up in this piece and the relationship pickling has to her Korean heritage.\n",

      "Shiyu went to the west of Sichuan, China in August 2020. At that time, the pandemic was well controlled, so people tended to pull down the mask and hang it over their chins to breathe the fresh air in the remote mountains. However, Shiyu saw that when people encountered strangers or unfamiliar places, they still wore the mask to show a \"safe distance\" from the strangeness and a \"sense of crisis\" towards the unknown. I believe that some people will continue to wear the mask for a long time after the pandemic. Under such conditions, has the meaning given to masks changed? Perhaps in the present or in the near future, we will rethink the definition of the sense of security, so as to achieve a subjective and active self-emotion regulation and inner harmony.\n",

      "## About Artwork\n",
      "This work is a revisitation and analysis of images taken while I was living in Italy during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, with an emphasis on photos from a weekend trip to Venice on February 22, 2020. It was on this day that the first person in Italy died from the novel coronavirus. Although it was not supposed to be the last weekend of Carnevale celebrations, the rapid spread of the virus cancelled any sort of mass gathering in the region within days. The areas primarily impacted by the virus at this time, Milan and Venice and their surrounding regions, were eventually placed on complete lockdown, followed by the entirety of Italy and now everywhere else in the world. While in the moment I experienced Carnevale celebrations with great joy, I now only feel claustrophobic when I view these images and they hold new meanings for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This project revisits my collection of images from February 22 and their connection to the optical unconscious, exploring the concept of touch and how it will be redefined by the COVID-19 pandemic. It further includes perspectives other than my own through the use of a Google Form, crowdsourcing anonymous responses to the questions I was also asking myself about our society's shifting relationship with touch. The responses, alongside imagery from that day in Venice, are meant to be almost indistinguishable from one another to emulate a single collective voice. By highlighting the similarities and contrasts of societal perceptions of touch, contextualized before, during, and after the pandemic, I hope to create an archival record that communicates how a global catastrophe is capable of reshaping basic human interaction as we know it.\n",

      "My work consists of photographing the beauty of nature, capturing the world through my perspective. Nature is peaceful, yet calming to me as it is expressed throughout my work. Although my images depict green sceneries, the desert is also intriguing to me by its appealing view of the silky warm sand. My photographs often reveal the ravishing structure of mother earth, traveling to different locations across California. At the age of twelve, my brother introduced me to photography and this became a hobby of mine, which turned into a profession throughout the years. Photography is a therapeutic outlet that not only brings out my creative side but is my forte for self-expression. \n",
      "\n",
      "I work with film and digital, keeping a great balance of both mediums. On some days, I prefer to capture outdoor photos with a digital or film camera as it depends on the setting of my environment. As a landscape and nature photographer, keeping a balance between film and digital allows me to alternate with different cameras. While out in nature, my process involves scanning my environment to adequately make sure that framing and composition are correctly positioned. Not only that but adjusting my aperture and shutter speed to the proper settings of my camera before taking a photograph. On occasions, I shoot with black and white film because it gives me a raw organic aesthetic when capturing landscapes, and makes the resulting image intense and strikingly beautiful. \n",
      "\n",
      "These photographs are a reminder to look at the beauty surrounding nature as people can forget to appreciate mother earth. We live in a current state where technology is advancing day by day, resulting in our lost connection with the everyday natural world. Besides, my images convey the mindfulness and peacefulness that nature brings. Ultimately, this body of work expresses the incredible magic, mother nature showcases, further reminding others that places like these exist throughout the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## About Artwork\n",
      "As a landscape photographer, the pandemic hindered my ability to capture photographs of nature in a time of uncertainty. Quarantine challenged me to push my work further — and be utterly grateful for the beauty that already surrounded me, approaching photography through a different lens. I began photographing the movement of clouds during golden hour, resulting in creating a body of work titled ‘Do You Want Cotton Candy?’ These images reveal a dream-like aesthetic with clouds formulating beautiful uniquely shapes. Although this work dates back to mid-April of 2020, it is series that I continue to further develop today. \n",

      "My piece \"Just Survive\" is about how it's enough to simply live. In our society, being productive is seen as our only goal in life. We place so much of our self worth on productivity whether that is with academics, self care, etc. This is one of the reasons why the corona virus pandemic has had such a huge effect on many people. I wanted to share the message that especially during a time like there where our ability to be conventionally \"productive\" has been stripped away, it is perfectly normal and okay to feel lost and unmotivated.\n",

      "Yingru is a senior stutent in UCLA. She started dancing at the age of five, after her parents enrolled her into her local ballet studio, hoping that she will gain some lifelong skills that will carry into her future. What they didn't expect, however, was for her to genuinely pursue dance full-heartedly as both artistic and academic realms of study. After being given dance and choreographic opportunities throughout high school, Yingru affirmed her love for dance as an expressionist medium and studied under UCLA's World Arts and Culture/Dance department to further explore and research her artistic whims. To this day, Yingru continues to do primarily solo work, utilizing both the dance and film mediums to fulfill her explorations. She specifically created this current work \"Lexie: A Tale During Covid\" to document her own, millennial experiences during covid.\n",

      "### Introduction\n",
      "I have always been drawn to narrative and even at its most abstract my work suggests a plot. I have found that referencing a story is an effective way to explore my own particular conceptual ideas, and a compelling way to engage an audience. Painting one image often does not fully express the ideas I am exploring, but painting several images and thoughtfully juxtaposing them next each other they begin to create their own visual language. My approach to creating work has begun to resemble writing which I rigorously edit.  As I pin paintings to the wall, I layer, remove, reconfigure and repaint until a compelling narrative begins to form.  I frequently refer to my library of old books and magazines searching for relevant texts which I transcribe into the painted works.  As I paint the work expands and shrinks finding unexpected directions, sometimes growing until it fills entire walls. \n",

      "## About Artwork\n",
      "I was spinning out after two weeks of feeling dread due to uncertainty of the future. No one understood the potential lethality of the virus, my job was in jeopardy, and my recent college graduate son was struggling and full of despair. I was attempting to work in the studio on pre-Covid paintings but finding it difficult to settle and focus. After our first pandemic trip the grocery store, and, after spending an hour wiping every purchase down with disinfectant I began to consider our new world.  What previous innocuous objects have suddenly become heavy with Corona baggage. A bag of groceries is now a vector for potential death.  So I painted the groceries, an artifact of our new fear.  Then each day in order to find some stable ground, I painted a new artifact, masks, swabs what ever was suddenly filling the news.  As the pandemic progressed and layers of social dysfunction revealed itself I attempted to represent it in a painting, trying not to editorialize, just to document.  Here in the US, the incompetency and lack of leadership concerning the pandemic and the civil unrests that evolved out of it became subject matter. Initially I added occasional humor to my pieces, but that seems more difficult as time passes.  I have no idea how long I can continue, though I am finding it necessary for my own state of mind to keep painting and build an archive of this time.\n",
