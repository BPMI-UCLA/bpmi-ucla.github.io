My piece "Just Survive" is about how it's enough to simply live. In our society, being productive is seen as our only goal in life. We place so much of our self worth on productivity whether that is with academics, self care, etc. This is one of the reasons why the corona virus pandemic has had such a huge effect on many people. I wanted to share the message that especially during a time like there where our ability to be conventionally "productive" has been stripped away, it is perfectly normal and okay to feel lost and unmotivated.
