A painting in response to losing her job as a dancer during the pandemic. What helped lessen her anxiety of lost wages, lost identity and the freedom of a part time job during school was food preservation in the form of pickling, where she began directing her energy into experimenting making various kinds of pickles. Jokingly, alluding to “hanging heels” up in exchange for pickled vegetables. Some have commented on how domesticity shows up in this piece and the relationship pickling has to her Korean heritage.
