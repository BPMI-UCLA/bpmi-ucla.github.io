**Artist Name:** Yingru Huang

### Introduction
Yingru is a senior stutent in UCLA. She started dancing at the age of five, after her parents enrolled her into her local ballet studio, hoping that she will gain some lifelong skills that will carry into her future. What they didn¡¯t expect, however, was for her to genuinely pursue dance full-heartedly as both artistic and academic realms of study. After being given dance and choreographic opportunities throughout high school, Yingru affirmed her love for dance as an expressionist medium and studied under UCLA¡¯s World Arts and Culture/Dance department to further explore and research her artistic whims. To this day, Yingru continues to do primarily solo work, utilizing both the dance and film mediums to fulfill her explorations. She specifically created this current work ¡°Lexie: A Tale During Covid¡± to document her own, millennial experiences during covid.
