### Introduction
Big Rex is a graphic designer based in Peru. He tries to create and communicate a message of reflection through a stance towards what he sees every day. His ideas are based on playing different stories that take place in the same space in parallel time. His artwork is full of very unique surreal characters which are inspired by everyday life situations, experiences, old magazines, storybooks and ideas about what the future will be.
