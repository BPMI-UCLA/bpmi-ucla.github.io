The idea of East Coast first came to my mind while flying from Shanghai to New York. At that time, my goal was to just write a song about the airport, this place full with farewells and reunions.

This pandemic is full with hustles, unexpectedness, and movements international students or foreigners. March 2020, due to COVID-10, I also was in a hustle packing my bags, hopping on a flight to go back home to China. Before I left New York, I finished this song, featuring my friend Yao Jiu. 

This song is for all of us on the road.
