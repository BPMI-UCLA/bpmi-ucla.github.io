While at times seemingly irreverent - the works are inspired by and react to; traditional, texts, and rituals. He sees his art as a vehicle for promoting dialogue, a catalyst for provoking people into re-evaluating their preconceptions, a medium for breaking down stereotypes, and an opportunity for people of all walks of life to connect with theirs and others' religion, culture, and history.\n",

      "In the United States, it has been about ten months since the quarantine threw our lives out of the familiar track. I think my relationships with other people suffered the most, and many people started to have pets to fill in the blanks and welcome them as part of their families. This painting features my friend’s cat Potato, who I met for a few times on several “dates”. That he comes from another family deepens the novelty I felt each time I met him, and this time I fell for his new bow tie and his innocent pride. I hope that when the pandemic is over, we can still remember these moving moments when we make interspecies connections and take good care of our companions through the hard times.   \n",

      "The current situation in the context of a pandemic led to the fact that, faced with the obligation of compulsory isolation, the structural inequality of my country became evident. Quarantine today is a privilege that many cannot have due to the conditions that violate their rights to a formal job, the exacerbated regional disparity and the social groups that are usually already at risk, experience it as a terrible reality. The laziness of years never democratized basic sanitary conditions, one of the simplest actions in the prevention of covid-19, such as washing our hands, is the greatest desire of those who today don`t have access to water. In the most populated capital city of the country, in the most vulnerable neighborhoods even today after months of quarantine, there is a lack of water. The pandemic spat in our faces that it is time to question the social dynamics and urgencies in public policy that in the meantime are taking the lives of many.\n",

      "Kayla Tange was born in South Korea and adopted by a Japanese American family. Her love for poetry and photography slowly progressed into a conceptual performance practice which incorporates elements of exotic dancing. Physical and psychic boundaries, sexuality and  permanence are also recurring themes. She often uses dark comedy in her performance work to explore love and longing, societal taboos and catharsis. She is the co-producer of Sacred Wounds, a show around ritual, subverting cultural stereotypes and ancestral healing.\n",

      "## About Artwork\n",
      "A painting in response to losing her job as a dancer during the pandemic. What helped lessen her anxiety of lost wages, lost identity and the freedom of a part time job during school was food preservation in the form of pickling, where she began directing her energy into experimenting making various kinds of pickles. Jokingly, alluding to “hanging heels” up in exchange for pickled vegetables. Some have commented on how domesticity shows up in this piece and the relationship pickling has to her Korean heritage.\n",

In addition, it was interesting for me to trace through objects how some of them (masks, gloves, toilet paper) became luxury objects.\n",

      "Shiyu went to the west of Sichuan, China in August 2020. At that time, the pandemic was well controlled, so people tended to pull down the mask and hang it over their chins to breathe the fresh air in the remote mountains. However, Shiyu saw that when people encountered strangers or unfamiliar places, they still wore the mask to show a \"safe distance\" from the strangeness and a \"sense of crisis\" towards the unknown. I believe that some people will continue to wear the mask for a long time after the pandemic. Under such conditions, has the meaning given to masks changed? Perhaps in the present or in the near future, we will rethink the definition of the sense of security, so as to achieve a subjective and active self-emotion regulation and inner harmony.\n",

      "Based on the actual situation in China during the epidemic, this work ponders what will affect people when the disaster comes. The living habits of contemporary people have made people inseparable from modern logistics. During the epidemic, the increasingly high reward amount for couriers and the trend that everything is available for takeout make me reconsider the possibility of modern logistics. Based on the above situation, I designed this \"NCC\", which takes the family as the unit to realize contactless logistics. Moreover, through field research and data measurement, it has certain feasibility of landing and putting into the production line. In addition, while solving the survival problems brought by the disaster, the form of \"sending out a song\" will also make the whole process more human, which may create more interesting interactive situations for the receiver and the sender. Under the heavy disaster, it may bring some relaxation and warmth to both sides.\n",

      "This work is a revisitation and analysis of images taken while I was living in Italy during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, with an emphasis on photos from a weekend trip to Venice on February 22, 2020. It was on this day that the first person in Italy died from the novel coronavirus. Although it was not supposed to be the last weekend of Carnevale celebrations, the rapid spread of the virus cancelled any sort of mass gathering in the region within days. The areas primarily impacted by the virus at this time, Milan and Venice and their surrounding regions, were eventually placed on complete lockdown, followed by the entirety of Italy and now everywhere else in the world. While in the moment I experienced Carnevale celebrations with great joy, I now only feel claustrophobic when I view these images and they hold new meanings for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This project revisits my collection of images from February 22 and their connection to the optical unconscious, exploring the concept of touch and how it will be redefined by the COVID-19 pandemic. It further includes perspectives other than my own through the use of a Google Form, crowdsourcing anonymous responses to the questions I was also asking myself about our society's shifting relationship with touch. The responses, alongside imagery from that day in Venice, are meant to be almost indistinguishable from one another to emulate a single collective voice. By highlighting the similarities and contrasts of societal perceptions of touch, contextualized before, during, and after the pandemic, I hope to create an archival record that communicates how a global catastrophe is capable of reshaping basic human interaction as we know it.\n",

We have been inseparable since our childhood.  Now, to see Tae-Jung as a Mother, as a caretaker, as a primary nurturer, and as a symbol of feminine maturity is breathtaking to capture in this portraiture, <Tae Jung and Ha Ru >. \n",

      "My piece \"Just Survive\" is about how it's enough to simply live. In our society, being productive is seen as our only goal in life. We place so much of our self worth on productivity whether that is with academics, self care, etc. This is one of the reasons why the corona virus pandemic has had such a huge effect on many people. I wanted to share the message that especially during a time like there where our ability to be conventionally \"productive\" has been stripped away, it is perfectly normal and okay to feel lost and unmotivated.\n",

      "This work is a visualization of my dreams during the pandemic period. The installation demonstrates the nature of chaotic dreams while maintaining a sense of balance and connection amidst all the fractures. As a whole, the work is a human body whose “skin,” the canvas paper, is penetrated and connected simultaneously by electronic wires resembling blood vessels. The balloons arranged in different ways are various human organs and infesting viruses occupying the body. The outermost parts are gestural drawings inspired by the overview of the neighborhood where my parents are living through the pandemic in Wuhan, China. It is also one of the locations that has suffered the greatest casualties and longest quarantine during the tragedy. By piecing together broken imageries that have deeply impacted me both in dreams and reality, I make a personal statement about the pandemic that has now connected every individual of our global village.\n",

      "In Spring 2020, many states in the US imposed lockdowns due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. While some people find comfort at home, most others struggle with limited human interactions. More people around me were having more downtimes than before, and that was when I decided to make something that help people discover the little happy moments.\n",

      "Facemask is 2020’s most iconic and important visual motif. It has moved from being a simple piece of PPE to a badge of honour, worn by the heroes who have kept our society functioning during the most disruptive collective experience since World War II. Artists and designers are using this motif within their work to help reframe our perception, its inclusion in stunning images and positive narratives encourages the daily use of them by the public, a critical step in shaping our choices moving forward.\n",

      "Using only the materials I happened to have in Lockdown with me I set out to say a visual thank you to all 8 groups of Key Workers. I wanted to turn my suddenly free evenings, weekends and canceled work time into something positive. I used only recycled, reclaimed and biodegradable materials in the building of the masks and costumes. The images draw from science fiction, Buddhist paintings and religious motifs to create high status images that celebrate these incredible individuals.\n",

My creative works include Oil paintings, digital paintings and wall murals. I paint anytime, anywhere and pretty much all the time and everywhere. My artworks are usually inspired from travel, music and nature. Living in the process of creation helps me fully own the artwork. My goal as an artist is to create works that bring peace, comfort and warmth, and maybe help people a little bit in bringing out emotions in the daily struggles of life.\n",

      "This is a digital painting that I had created at the beginning of this year as a reminder to all the people out there “it’s still Covid outside but if you have survived 2020 then be proud of yourself. It has been an overwhelming year for all of us as we watched the whole world hit a pause. We all have been staying at home, some exploring new interests, some struggling mentally and some rediscovering themselves. And even if you have done nothing except survive the pandemic, I want you to know that you are still valued and I’m proud of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I used the colors blue and yellow for a contrast representation of melancholy, lack of emotions, and happiness and warmth. I wish this artwork brings you much love, strength, and hope.\n",

      "Fiona Hsu was born in February of 2001 in Orange County, California. At the age of five, her artistic journey ignited when her mother encourages her to make paper dolls instead of playing with cheap plastic toys. As she became better with her hands, her paper friends inspired her to keep creating. And so a passion for art ignited. She started drawing and painting on her own ever since, and during her recovery from a foot tendon surgery back in 2015, she developed blazing passion for fine art photography at the age of fourteen.\n",
      "Her works capture the aspects of beauty within woeful and melancholic definitions that narrate quaint and odd stories, in which she hopes her art serves as rusty mirrors for her audience—reflecting and reminding them of a quality and/or memory from the past.\n",

      "Fiona’s artworks are inspired by her dreams at night, her childhood imaginations, and the complex forms of emotions she discovered within herself. After all, Fiona’s surreal photographs are meant for her to relive the dreams she kept safely in her dream journal and imagine the ones that haven’t yet been dreamed in her slumber. And her drawings and paintings and meant for her to remember a memory, emotion, and/or secret she encountered in her life.\n",

      "## About Artwork\n",
      "When you sacrifice yourself, would you let it be known to the world?\n",
      "At times it feels that the value and power of a self sacrifice should only be validated by the quietness and silence when bearing the pain, all for something or someone. And so many of us withhold a flame within our shells, and turn away from the pain while it burns up our insides, until it eventually breaks out. \n",

      "I’m Danyang, an artist based on ceramics. My works involve modern ceramics, industrial design and new media art. The topics I explored include individual emotion and feelings, culture conflict and social issues. The material of ceramics plays a key role in my works. Other materials, covering wood and metal, are also included. Ceramics, as a traditional Chinese material, inspire me to create works to reflect Chinese culture, meanwhile, it also encourages me to explore various possibilities of ceramics in modern art and combination with other mediums. \n",

      "## About Artwork\n",
      "'I'm fine, and you’ is a ceramic installation work composes of more than one hundred objects. Through the changes in the shape of the utensils, this work expresses the insecurity, anxiety and mental recovery process I feel under the Covid-19 epidemic. I hope this work can bring positive psychological hints, humanistic care and confidence to overcome the challenges.\n",

She started dancing at the age of five, after her parents enrolled her into her local ballet studio, hoping that she will gain some lifelong skills that will carry into her future. What they didn¡¯t expect, however, was for her to genuinely pursue dance full-heartedly as both artistic and academic realms of study. After being given dance and choreographic opportunities throughout high school, Yingru affirmed her love for dance as an expressionist medium and studied under UCLA¡¯s World Arts and Culture/Dance department to further explore and research her artistic whims. To this day, Yingru continues to do primarily solo work, utilizing both the dance and film mediums to fulfill her explorations. She specifically created this current work ¡°Lexie: A Tale During Covid¡± to document her own, millennial experiences during covid.\n",

      "I have always been drawn to narrative and even at its most abstract my work suggests a plot. I have found that referencing a story is an effective way to explore my own particular conceptual ideas, and a compelling way to engage an audience. Painting one image often does not fully express the ideas I am exploring, but painting several images and thoughtfully juxtaposing them next each other they begin to create their own visual language. My approach to creating work has begun to resemble writing which I rigorously edit.  As I pin paintings to the wall, I layer, remove, reconfigure and repaint until a compelling narrative begins to form.  I frequently refer to my library of old books and magazines searching for relevant texts which I transcribe into the painted works.  As I paint the work expands and shrinks finding unexpected directions, sometimes growing until it fills entire walls. \n",

      "## About Artwork\n",
      "I was spinning out after two weeks of feeling dread due to uncertainty of the future. No one understood the potential lethality of the virus, my job was in jeopardy, and my recent college graduate son was struggling and full of despair. I was attempting to work in the studio on pre-Covid paintings but finding it difficult to settle and focus. After our first pandemic trip the grocery store, and, after spending an hour wiping every purchase down with disinfectant I began to consider our new world.  What previous innocuous objects have suddenly become heavy with Corona baggage. A bag of groceries is now a vector for potential death.  So I painted the groceries, an artifact of our new fear.  Then each day in order to find some stable ground, I painted a new artifact, masks, swabs what ever was suddenly filling the news.  As the pandemic progressed and layers of social dysfunction revealed itself I attempted to represent it in a painting, trying not to editorialize, just to document.  Here in the US, the incompetency and lack of leadership concerning the pandemic and the civil unrests that evolved out of it became subject matter. Initially I added occasional humor to my pieces, but that seems more difficult as time passes.  I have no idea how long I can continue, though I am finding it necessary for my own state of mind to keep painting and build an archive of this time.\n",

      "## About Artwork\n",
      "For this project (completed May 2020), I researched the history of cartography and how artists can use maps to represent complex and poetic ideas. Because maps are so critical to helping us feel like we know where we are, I became interested in the idea of being lost, and what makes it unsettling but also valuable. After leaving a semester school program I had been in last spring and staying in quarantine, I have struggled with mental health and feeling “lost” internally. I find myself wishing I had a map, or some concrete sense of direction to help me feel less uncertain. \n",
      "\n",
      "In my animation, I am exploring how creating maps can be a tool for “finding oneself” and expressing ideas about our surroundings. Incorporating research and inspiration from artists and cartographers, I created a personal map of quarantine, my experience leaving school, and my concerns about the future. The video alternates between scenes of the main character (a self portrait) and different views into her thoughts and memories in the form of maps. The film includes maps of my house, Oxbow school, the USA, and several more abstract maps of the thoughts and feelings circling inside of my head. \n",
      "\n",
      "My work is also influenced by being pen pals with some of my classmates, the postal delivery service, and how we can try to feel closer to people even when they are far away. I was also inspired by different time zones and how we are all sort of connected through Zoom. I intend for this piece to communicate feelings about the world today that others may relate to, and acknowledge how quarantine can affect teenagers like myself. \n",

      "### Introduction\n",
      "My work consists of photographing the beauty of nature, capturing the world through my perspective. Nature is peaceful, yet calming to me as it is expressed throughout my work. Although my images depict green sceneries, the desert is also intriguing to me by its appealing view of the silky warm sand. My photographs often reveal the ravishing structure of mother earth, traveling to different locations across California. At the age of twelve, my brother introduced me to photography and this became a hobby of mine, which turned into a profession throughout the years. Photography is a therapeutic outlet that not only brings out my creative side but is my forte for self-expression. \n",
      "\n",
      "I work with film and digital, keeping a great balance of both mediums. On some days, I prefer to capture outdoor photos with a digital or film camera as it depends on the setting of my environment. As a landscape and nature photographer, keeping a balance between film and digital allows me to alternate with different cameras. While out in nature, my process involves scanning my environment to adequately make sure that framing and composition are correctly positioned. Not only that but adjusting my aperture and shutter speed to the proper settings of my camera before taking a photograph. On occasions, I shoot with black and white film because it gives me a raw organic aesthetic when capturing landscapes, and makes the resulting image intense and strikingly beautiful. \n",
      "\n",
      "These photographs are a reminder to look at the beauty surrounding nature as people can forget to appreciate mother earth. We live in a current state where technology is advancing day by day, resulting in our lost connection with the everyday natural world. Besides, my images convey the mindfulness and peacefulness that nature brings. Ultimately, this body of work expresses the incredible magic, mother nature showcases, further reminding others that places like these exist throughout the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## About Artwork\n",
      "As a landscape photographer, the pandemic hindered my ability to capture photographs of nature in a time of uncertainty. Quarantine challenged me to push my work further — and be utterly grateful for the beauty that already surrounded me, approaching photography through a different lens. I began photographing the movement of clouds during golden hour, resulting in creating a body of work titled ‘Do You Want Cotton Candy?’ These images reveal a dream-like aesthetic with clouds formulating beautiful uniquely shapes. Although this work dates back to mid-April of 2020, it is series that I continue to further develop today. \n",
