This work is part of a series of pieces called "Berlins Answer". Berlin/Germany has a huge underground fetish scene, the gasmasks, latex, bondage etc is in a way detaching from the world or reality, the pandemic has told us to â€œisolate". The bondage/sensory deprivation is an isolation, they go hand in hand. Here, l played on these facts, that this is maybe how the fetish community would isolate in another world. The train is exclusive to the city of Berlin.
