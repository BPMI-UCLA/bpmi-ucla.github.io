The work originated from my fear of pandemics and other diseases, drawing on the image of virus-infected cells, cancer cells, blood vessels, and gas masks, and giving the work a "breathing" effect through programming and new conductive materials. I hope to express the things I fear and the process of defeating my fears in the form of beauty, embodying my own artistic view of life and death.
