**Artist Name:** Danyang Song 

### Introduction 
Iâ€™m Danyang, an artist based on ceramics. My works involve modern ceramics, industrial design and new media art. The topics I explored include individual emotion and feelings, culture conflict and social issues. The material of ceramics plays a key role in my works. Other materials, covering wood and metal, are also included. Ceramics, as a traditional Chinese material, inspire me to create works to reflect Chinese culture, meanwhile, it also encourages me to explore various possibilities of ceramics in modern art and combination with other mediums.
