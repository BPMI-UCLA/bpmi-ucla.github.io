'I'm fine, and youâ€™ is a ceramic installation work composes of more than one hundred objects. Through the changes in the shape of the utensils, this work expresses the insecurity, anxiety and mental recovery process I feel under the Covid-19 epidemic. I hope this work can bring positive psychological hints, humanistic care and confidence to overcome the challenges.
