While at times seemingly irreverent - the works are inspired by and react to; traditional, texts, and rituals. He sees his art as a vehicle for promoting dialogue, a catalyst for provoking people into re-evaluating their preconceptions, a medium for breaking down stereotypes, and an opportunity for people of all walks of life to connect with theirs and others' religion, culture, and history.\n",

      "In the United States, it has been about ten months since the quarantine threw our lives out of the familiar track. I think my relationships with other people suffered the most, and many people started to have pets to fill in the blanks and welcome them as part of their families. This painting features my friend’s cat Potato, who I met for a few times on several “dates”. That he comes from another family deepens the novelty I felt each time I met him, and this time I fell for his new bow tie and his innocent pride. I hope that when the pandemic is over, we can still remember these moving moments when we make interspecies connections and take good care of our companions through the hard times.   \n",
