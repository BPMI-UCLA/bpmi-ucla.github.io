Facemask is 2020â€™s most iconic and important visual motif. It has moved from being a simple piece of PPE to a badge of honour, worn by the heroes who have kept our society functioning during the most disruptive collective experience since World War II. Artists and designers are using this motif within their work to help reframe our perception, its inclusion in stunning images and positive narratives encourages the daily use of them by the public, a critical step in shaping our choices moving forward.

Using only the materials I happened to have in Lockdown with me I set out to say a visual thank you to all 8 groups of Key Workers. I wanted to turn my suddenly free evenings, weekends and canceled work time into something positive. I used only recycled, reclaimed and biodegradable materials in the building of the masks and costumes. The images draw from science fiction, Buddhist paintings and religious motifs to create high status images that celebrate these incredible individuals.
