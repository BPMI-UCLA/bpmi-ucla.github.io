As a landscape photographer, the pandemic hindered my ability to capture photographs of nature in a time of uncertainty. Quarantine challenged me to push my work further — and be utterly grateful for the beauty that already surrounded me, approaching photography through a different lens. I began photographing the movement of clouds during golden hour, resulting in creating a body of work titled ‘Do You Want Cotton Candy?’ These images reveal a dream-like aesthetic with clouds formulating beautiful uniquely shapes. Although this work dates back to mid-April of 2020, it is series that I continue to further develop today.
