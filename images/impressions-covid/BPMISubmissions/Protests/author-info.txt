**Artist Name:** Joshua Windsor 

### Introduction 
Originally from New Zealand, I developed a passion for photography during a year-long trip to South America. Since then, I relocated to London and undertook a masters degree in philosophy and now work full-time as a travel photographer. With travel currently hindered due to COVID-19, I have turned my lens to documenting the social impact of the pandemic and related protests.
