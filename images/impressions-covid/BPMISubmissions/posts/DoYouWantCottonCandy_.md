## About Author

### Introduction
My work consists of photographing the beauty of nature, capturing the world through my perspective. Nature is peaceful, yet calming to me as it is expressed throughout my work. Although my images depict green sceneries, the desert is also intriguing to me by its appealing view of the silky warm sand. My photographs often reveal the ravishing structure of mother earth, traveling to different locations across California. At the age of twelve, my brother introduced me to photography and this became a hobby of mine, which turned into a profession throughout the years. Photography is a therapeutic outlet that not only brings out my creative side but is my forte for self-expression. 

I work with film and digital, keeping a great balance of both mediums. On some days, I prefer to capture outdoor photos with a digital or film camera as it depends on the setting of my environment. As a landscape and nature photographer, keeping a balance between film and digital allows me to alternate with different cameras. While out in nature, my process involves scanning my environment to adequately make sure that framing and composition are correctly positioned. Not only that but adjusting my aperture and shutter speed to the proper settings of my camera before taking a photograph. On occasions, I shoot with black and white film because it gives me a raw organic aesthetic when capturing landscapes, and makes the resulting image intense and strikingly beautiful. 

These photographs are a reminder to look at the beauty surrounding nature as people can forget to appreciate mother earth. We live in a current state where technology is advancing day by day, resulting in our lost connection with the everyday natural world. Besides, my images convey the mindfulness and peacefulness that nature brings. Ultimately, this body of work expresses the incredible magic, mother nature showcases, further reminding others that places like these exist throughout the world. 


## About Artwork
As a landscape photographer, the pandemic hindered my ability to capture photographs of nature in a time of uncertainty. Quarantine challenged me to push my work further — and be utterly grateful for the beauty that already surrounded me, approaching photography through a different lens. I began photographing the movement of clouds during golden hour, resulting in creating a body of work titled ‘Do You Want Cotton Candy?’ These images reveal a dream-like aesthetic with clouds formulating beautiful uniquely shapes. Although this work dates back to mid-April of 2020, it is series that I continue to further develop today.
