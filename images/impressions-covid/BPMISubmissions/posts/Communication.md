## About Author

**Artist Name:** Xuemei Ge 

### Introduction 
I am an artist, also a warrior. I use art as a language and weapon to break free from the shackles that society has given to everyrone and pursue the world which I want. 

## About Artwork
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our communication was blocked by masks. Masks not only block viruses, but also block the acceptance of information from person to person.
