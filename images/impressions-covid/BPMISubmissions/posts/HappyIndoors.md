## About Artwork
In Spring 2020, many states in the US imposed lockdowns due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. While some people find comfort at home, most others struggle with limited human interactions. More people around me were having more downtimes than before, and that was when I decided to make something that help people discover the little happy moments.

I asked people what they're grateful during quarantine and turned their responses into illustrations. Then, I prototyped out the interaction and built the website and an audio-triggered animation system. The user would be required to read these happy moments out loud to experience the magic of animation.
