## About Artwork
Zoom fatigue, a new phenomenon emerging from overuse within virtual platforms, is very real. Symptoms of this digital distraction include worry, tiredness, and burnout. Being a UCLA student still engaged in the intensity of the quarter system and managing several classes during a pandemic has made us spend days inside our screens. It's important to still get some sunlight and sleep, with safety.
