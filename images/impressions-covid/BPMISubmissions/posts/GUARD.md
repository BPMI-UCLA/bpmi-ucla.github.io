## About Artwork
This poster was finished in early 2021. In the picture, a doctor with tired eyes silently guards a little girl with his wings. Our current easy life comes from these people who dedicate themselves silently and don't ask for rewards are bearing the burden for us. The tired eyes of the doctor, the faint wrinkles between the eyebrows and the puffiness all revealed the menacing force of the pandemic and the hard work of the medical staff. Each feather in the picture represents every drop of sweat left by the doctor during this period to protect us. It is this sweat that has prevented us from the virus.
