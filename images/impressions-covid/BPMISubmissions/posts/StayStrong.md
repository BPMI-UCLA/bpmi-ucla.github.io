## About Author

**Artist Name:** Erin O'Neil 

### Introduction
Erin is a pre-math major at UCLA. I have created art for as long as I can remember and will continue to pursue it as a hobby during college. I love to use acrylic paints but also enjoy mediums such as charcoal and watercolor. 




## About Artwork
Stay Strong depicts the exhaustion of frontline workers who are waiting for relief. They are working tirelessly to provide care for sick people during the seemingly endless pandemic. I can only imagine the emotional and physical toll this line of work currently entails. The nurse was painted in blue to represent feelings of gloom; the mask was painted a bright red because it is a central symbol of the pandemic.
