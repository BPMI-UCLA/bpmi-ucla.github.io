### Introduction
I have always been drawn to narrative and even at its most abstract my work suggests a plot. I have found that referencing a story is an effective way to explore my own particular conceptual ideas, and a compelling way to engage an audience. Painting one image often does not fully express the ideas I am exploring, but painting several images and thoughtfully juxtaposing them next each other they begin to create their own visual language. My approach to creating work has begun to resemble writing which I rigorously edit.  As I pin paintings to the wall, I layer, remove, reconfigure and repaint until a compelling narrative begins to form.  I frequently refer to my library of old books and magazines searching for relevant texts which I transcribe into the painted works.  As I paint the work expands and shrinks finding unexpected directions, sometimes growing until it fills entire walls. 



## About Artwork
I was spinning out after two weeks of feeling dread due to uncertainty of the future. No one understood the potential lethality of the virus, my job was in jeopardy, and my recent college graduate son was struggling and full of despair. I was attempting to work in the studio on pre-Covid paintings but finding it difficult to settle and focus. After our first pandemic trip the grocery store, and, after spending an hour wiping every purchase down with disinfectant I began to consider our new world.  What previous innocuous objects have suddenly become heavy with Corona baggage. A bag of groceries is now a vector for potential death.  So I painted the groceries, an artifact of our new fear.  Then each day in order to find some stable ground, I painted a new artifact, masks, swabs what ever was suddenly filling the news.  As the pandemic progressed and layers of social dysfunction revealed itself I attempted to represent it in a painting, trying not to editorialize, just to document.  Here in the US, the incompetency and lack of leadership concerning the pandemic and the civil unrests that evolved out of it became subject matter. Initially I added occasional humor to my pieces, but that seems more difficult as time passes.  I have no idea how long I can continue, though I am finding it necessary for my own state of mind to keep painting and build an archive of this time.
