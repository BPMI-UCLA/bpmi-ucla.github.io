### Introduction
Ken Goldman is an artist based in Israel. His art is filled with insider references innuendos and humor. While at times seemingly irreverent - the works are inspired by and react to; traditional, texts, and rituals. He sees his art as a vehicle for promoting dialogue, a catalyst for provoking people into re-evaluating their preconceptions, a medium for breaking down stereotypes, and an opportunity for people of all walks of life to connect with theirs and others' religion, culture, and history.

## About Artwork
"Pandemic Fossils"- carved local stone / limestone - 2020

Confronted by endless Pandemic Litters polluting the area made me think what future archaeologists will make of the strata they uncover form these pandemic times.
