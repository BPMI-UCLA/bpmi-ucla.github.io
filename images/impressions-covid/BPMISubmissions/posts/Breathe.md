## About Author

**Artist Name:** Spandana Urlam 

### Introduction
Spandana Urlam is a self-taught artist based in India. I am a computer science engineering student but super busy chasing my dream of being a full-time artist. My creative works include Oil paintings, digital paintings and wall murals. I paint anytime, anywhere and pretty much all the time and everywhere. My artworks are usually inspired from travel, music and nature. Living in the process of creation helps me fully own the artwork. My goal as an artist is to create works that bring peace, comfort and warmth, and maybe help people a little bit in bringing out emotions in the daily struggles of life.





## About Artwork
This is a digital painting that I had created at the beginning of this year as a reminder to all the people out there “it’s still Covid outside but if you have survived 2020 then be proud of yourself. It has been an overwhelming year for all of us as we watched the whole world hit a pause. We all have been staying at home, some exploring new interests, some struggling mentally and some rediscovering themselves. And even if you have done nothing except survive the pandemic, I want you to know that you are still valued and I’m proud of you.”

I used the colors blue and yellow for a contrast representation of melancholy, lack of emotions, and happiness and warmth. I wish this artwork brings you much love, strength, and hope.
