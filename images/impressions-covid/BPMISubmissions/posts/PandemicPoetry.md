## About Artwork
The following poems were inspired by the roller coaster of emotions that I and many others have faced during the pandemic. They focus mainly on the ups and down of isolation as well as the process of adjusting to our new world.

### The Separation of Time and Life
While I live, my life’s being taken
I long for the world we’ve forsaken.

I spend my time sitting on empty roofs, talking to lonely moons, 
I ask them about isolation and loss of youth.

I get lost in talks with Father Time 
He takes me on trips void of body and wholly mind.

I grieve a life that was never mine.
I yearn for the world we’ve left behind.

### Calm and Chaos
The world is ablaze
And yet here I lay, peaceful as gardens of zen.
If nothing else, I’ve been kind to myself. A reunion with a long lost friend.
I’ve nurtured my wounds in the midst of Earth’s ruins.
I uncover the sores I’ve been known to conceal.
I give myself permission to hurt and to heal.

### Within these walls
The four walls of my room which used to mean comfort, now speak whispers of doom.
A rose meant for gardens, now shrouded in darkness, searches for reasons to bloom.

I refuse to let dreams tempt me with what might have been. I do not dare to let indulgence in.
Seclusion and I have become akin, during my time within these walls.

I have watched the empire I was, grow dreary and fall.
