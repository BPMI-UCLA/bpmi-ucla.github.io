## About Artwork
The current situation in the context of a pandemic led to the fact that, faced with the obligation of compulsory isolation, the structural inequality of my country became evident. Quarantine today is a privilege that many cannot have due to the conditions that violate their rights to a formal job, the exacerbated regional disparity and the social groups that are usually already at risk, experience it as a terrible reality. The laziness of years never democratized basic sanitary conditions, one of the simplest actions in the prevention of covid-19, such as washing our hands, is the greatest desire of those who today don`t have access to water. In the most populated capital city of the country, in the most vulnerable neighborhoods even today after months of quarantine, there is a lack of water. The pandemic spat in our faces that it is time to question the social dynamics and urgencies in public policy that in the meantime are taking the lives of many.

The quarantine of Marcelo, my partner, portrays the privilege of accessing to those living conditions that allow reflection on the mandatory confinement of that time in pause and without haste, where routines, rituals and the coexistence of them are re-signified. inhabitants of a home.
