## About Artwork
This picture was taken in the catacombs of Kom el-Shoqafa in Alexandria, Egypt. It captures the ominous atmosphere that has infused every day life during the pandemic. Death has become as omnipresent as it is in the catacombs, which are part of the necropolis of ancient Alexandria. May the pandemic not make any of us stay six feet under.
