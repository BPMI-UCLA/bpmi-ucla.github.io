## About Artwork
This project was done in isolation, and it's a reflection on the rapid change in our environment due to coronavirus. My message here is more than clear. In this work and in the entire series, I examined various aspects of my new lifestyle and created photographs and collages from improvised materials that I found at home. In addition, it was interesting for me to trace through objects how some of them (masks, gloves, toilet paper) became luxury objects.
