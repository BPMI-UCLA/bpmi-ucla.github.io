## About Author

**Artist Name:** Kayla Tange

### Introduction:
Kayla Tange was born in South Korea and adopted by a Japanese American family. Her love for poetry and photography slowly progressed into a conceptual performance practice which incorporates elements of exotic dancing. Physical and psychic boundaries, sexuality and  permanence are also recurring themes. She often uses dark comedy in her performance work to explore love and longing, societal taboos and catharsis. She is the co-producer of Sacred Wounds, a show around ritual, subverting cultural stereotypes and ancestral healing.


## About Artwork
A painting in response to losing her job as a dancer during the pandemic. What helped lessen her anxiety of lost wages, lost identity and the freedom of a part time job during school was food preservation in the form of pickling, where she began directing her energy into experimenting making various kinds of pickles. Jokingly, alluding to “hanging heels” up in exchange for pickled vegetables. Some have commented on how domesticity shows up in this piece and the relationship pickling has to her Korean heritage.
