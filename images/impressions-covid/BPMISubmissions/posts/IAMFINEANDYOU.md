## About Author

**Artist Name:** Danyang Song 

### Introduction 
I’m Danyang, an artist based on ceramics. My works involve modern ceramics, industrial design and new media art. The topics I explored include individual emotion and feelings, culture conflict and social issues. The material of ceramics plays a key role in my works. Other materials, covering wood and metal, are also included. Ceramics, as a traditional Chinese material, inspire me to create works to reflect Chinese culture, meanwhile, it also encourages me to explore various possibilities of ceramics in modern art and combination with other mediums. 

## About Artwork
'I'm fine, and you’ is a ceramic installation work composes of more than one hundred objects. Through the changes in the shape of the utensils, this work expresses the insecurity, anxiety and mental recovery process I feel under the Covid-19 epidemic. I hope this work can bring positive psychological hints, humanistic care and confidence to overcome the challenges.
