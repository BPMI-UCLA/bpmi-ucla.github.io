## About Artwork
Staying at home is a major part of pandemic life. 2020 had already left and I think all of us hope for a restart in 2021. The art piece is made with my old T-shirt and some discarded cloth. The whole idea is a postcard sent to 2021 in 2020 with my expectations for 2021 on it. The winter is leaving, the spring is coming with flowers blooming, all the bad things will go away, and our lives will return to normal.
