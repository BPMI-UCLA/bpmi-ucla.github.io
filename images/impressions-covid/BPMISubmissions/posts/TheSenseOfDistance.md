## About Artwork
Shiyu went to the west of Sichuan, China in August 2020. At that time, the pandemic was well controlled, so people tended to pull down the mask and hang it over their chins to breathe the fresh air in the remote mountains. However, Shiyu saw that when people encountered strangers or unfamiliar places, they still wore the mask to show a "safe distance" from the strangeness and a "sense of crisis" towards the unknown. I believe that some people will continue to wear the mask for a long time after the pandemic. Under such conditions, has the meaning given to masks changed? Perhaps in the present or in the near future, we will rethink the definition of the sense of security, so as to achieve a subjective and active self-emotion regulation and inner harmony.
