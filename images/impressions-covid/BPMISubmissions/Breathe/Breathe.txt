This is a digital painting that I had created at the beginning of this year as a reminder to all the people out there “it’s still Covid outside but if you have survived 2020 then be proud of yourself. It has been an overwhelming year for all of us as we watched the whole world hit a pause. We all have been staying at home, some exploring new interests, some struggling mentally and some rediscovering themselves. And even if you have done nothing except survive the pandemic, I want you to know that you are still valued and I’m proud of you.”

I used the colors blue and yellow for a contrast representation of melancholy, lack of emotions, and happiness and warmth. I wish this artwork brings you much love, strength, and hope.
