**Artist Name:** Spandana Urlam 

### Introduction
Spandana Urlam is a self-taught artist based in India. I am a computer science engineering student but super busy chasing my dream of being a full-time artist. My creative works include Oil paintings, digital paintings and wall murals. I paint anytime, anywhere and pretty much all the time and everywhere. My artworks are usually inspired from travel, music and nature. Living in the process of creation helps me fully own the artwork. My goal as an artist is to create works that bring peace, comfort and warmth, and maybe help people a little bit in bringing out emotions in the daily struggles of life.
