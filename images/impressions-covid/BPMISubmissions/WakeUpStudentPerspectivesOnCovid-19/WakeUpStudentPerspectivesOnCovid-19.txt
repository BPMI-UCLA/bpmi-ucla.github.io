Created in summer 2020, the WAKE UP: Student Perspectives On COVID-19 Documentary includes the contributions of 34 students from 12 different countries, representing five continents. The documentary highlights the degree of impact the novel virus has had on a wide range of students. 

As COVID-19 has taken the world by storm, one thing has grown increasingly apparent. No matter where in the world you live, what your age or economic status is, we are all connected. The actions of one individual can deeply affect another. 

The documentary will change the way young people view the virus, and those helping to change the narrative will be students who are experiencing similar trials and tribulations.
