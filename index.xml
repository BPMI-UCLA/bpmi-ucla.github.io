      <description>About Author Artist Name: Anna Ziser
Introduction Anna Ziser is a student at UCLA, class of 2024.
About Artwork For this project (completed May 2020), I researched the history of cartography and how artists can use maps to represent complex and poetic ideas.

About Artwork The traditional Korean “Baek-il” event is a centuries-old tradition considered a norm in many Korean households. This signifies a major milestone within the Korean culture of a child’s 100th day after birth because of the high infant mortality during the 18th Century until the Korean War in the 1950s.
The photograph shows a double portraiture of my younger sister celebrating this milestone with her daughter dressed in the Hanbok during the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

About Artwork This project was done in isolation, and it&amp;rsquo;s a reflection on the rapid change in our environment due to coronavirus. My message here is more than clear. In this work and in the entire series, I examined various aspects of my new lifestyle and created photographs and collages from improvised materials that I found at home. In addition, it was interesting for me to trace through objects how some of them (masks, gloves, toilet paper) became luxury objects.</description>

      <description>About Author Artist Name: James Gouldthorpe
Introduction I have always been drawn to narrative and even at its most abstract my work suggests a plot. I have found that referencing a story is an effective way to explore my own particular conceptual ideas, and a compelling way to engage an audience. Painting one image often does not fully express the ideas I am exploring, but painting several images and thoughtfully juxtaposing them next each other they begin to create their own visual language.</description>

It has moved from being a simple piece of PPE to a badge of honour, worn by the heroes who have kept our society functioning during the most disruptive collective experience since World War II. Artists and designers are using this motif within their work to help reframe our perception, its inclusion in stunning images and positive narratives encourages the daily use of them by the public, a critical step in shaping our choices moving forward.</description>

Introduction Yingru is a senior stutent in UCLA. She started dancing at the age of five, after her parents enrolled her into her local ballet studio, hoping that she will gain some lifelong skills that will carry into her future. What they didn¡¯t expect, however, was for her to genuinely pursue dance full-heartedly as both artistic and academic realms of study. After being given dance and choreographic opportunities throughout high school, Yingru affirmed her love for dance as an expressionist medium and studied under UCLA¡¯s World Arts and Culture/Dance department to further explore and research her artistic whims.</description>

About Artwork Based on the actual situation in China during the epidemic, this work ponders what will affect people when the disaster comes. The living habits of contemporary people have made people inseparable from modern logistics. During the epidemic, the increasingly high reward amount for couriers and the trend that everything is available for takeout make me reconsider the possibility of modern logistics. Based on the above situation, I designed this &amp;ldquo;NCC&amp;rdquo;, which takes the family as the unit to realize contactless logistics.</description>
